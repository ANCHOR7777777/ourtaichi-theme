# OurTaiChi – Custom Dawn Theme

## Overview
This theme is a custom build for "OurTaiChi", a health course store, based on the official Shopify Dawn theme (v15.3.0). It transforms the default Dawn experience into a platform tailored for selling online courses, visually and functionally aligned with `https://taichizidong.com/`.

Key customizations include a new homepage layout with multiple custom sections, a product template optimized for digital goods, and a customer-only area for accessing purchased courses.

## Global Settings
Custom settings can be found in the Theme Customizer (`/`) under **Theme settings**.
- **Brand**: `Brand Accent Color` controls the main brand color used on buttons, etc.
- **Promo Banner**: `Enable promo banner` and associated settings to control the site-wide banner.
- **Cart Discount**: `Discount threshold` and `Discount message` to configure the cart incentive banner.

## Enabling Features

### Promo Banner
1. Go to **Theme settings > Promo Banner**.
2. Check `Enable promo banner`.
3. Fill in the text and adjust colors as needed.

### Multi-currency / Multi-language
Country and Language selectors are available in the theme but must be configured in your Shopify market settings first. Once configured, they will appear in the Header and Footer.

### "My Courses" Gated Page
1. In the Shopify Admin, go to **Online Store > Pages**.
2. Create a new page (e.g., with the title "My Courses").
3. In the **Theme template** dropdown on the right, select the `my-courses` template.
4. Save the page.
5. Go to **Online Store > Navigation** and add a link to this new page in your `Main menu`.

## Development Notes
- All custom CSS has been added to `assets/custom.css`.
- All custom JavaScript has been added to `assets/custom-carousel.js`.
- The `.theme-check.yml` file has been updated to ignore a transient linter error related to a placeholder snippet.

## Deploy & Preview Steps
1. Use the Shopify CLI to push changes to your store:
   `shopify theme push --store=your-store-name.myshopify.com`
2. **Assign Templates in Admin:**
   - For online course products, manually assign the **product.online-course** template from the product admin page.
   - For the "My Courses" page, assign the **page.my-courses** template (see instructions above).

## Known Issues / TODO
- **Linter Noise:** The theme linter may show warnings related to `scheme_classes`. This is a known issue from the base Dawn theme and can be ignored.
- **Video Streaming:** The "My Courses" page provides access links but does not include Digital Rights Management (DRM) for video content. For production, integration with an app like `Shopify Digital Downloads` or `Single` is recommended.
